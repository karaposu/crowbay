**CrowBay:**

### Overview
CrowBay is a peer-to-peer engagement platform that empowers businesses, influencers, and content creators to boost their online presence through **authentic interactions** from real people—no bots or fake profiles. The platform leverages **AI-driven verification** of screen recordings to ensure tasks are completed properly, offering a trustworthy solution in a crowded market.

### Key Features
1. **Telegram Bot Interface**  
   - Users interact with Crowboy via a Telegram bot, making it easy to start without needing a dedicated mobile app.  
   - The bot supports natural language input, so users can simply describe their needs (e.g., “I want engagement for my Instagram @ns_the_one”).

2. **Flexible Task Creation**  
   - Users set their own budgets, define target demographics (such as local or age-specific filters), choose the number of participants, and determine a timeline for task completion.  
   - Payment is made using crypto (for example, USDT), ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

3. **AI-Verified Screen Recordings**  
   - Task doers record their screens while performing the assigned actions (liking, commenting, following, or spending time on a profile).  
   - Crowboy’s AI system analyzes the recordings to verify that the task has been completed accurately.  
   - Upon successful verification, the task doer is paid.

4. **Marketplace Model**  
   - Task creators invest in genuine engagement, while task doers earn money by completing tasks.  
   - Crowboy retains a **10%** commission on every transaction as its service fee.

5. **User Filters & Demographics**  
   - Task givers can specify criteria such as location (e.g., users in their city), age range, or even specific interests to ensure engagement is both relevant and valuable.  
   - This targeted approach maximizes the impact of every task.

### How It Works (Simplified Flow)
1. **Task Creation**  
   - The user interacts with the Crowboy Telegram bot and describes the task in natural language (e.g., “Boost my Instagram @ns_the_one with likes, comments, and profile visits”).  
   - The bot prompts for further details: budget, demographic filters (e.g., “around my city, young people, university students”), the recommended number of participants (e.g., 5), and the desired timeline (e.g., “over the course of 3 weeks”).  
   - The bot summarizes the information and provides a newly generated wallet address for the user to pay their set budget.

2. **Task Acceptance**  
   - Once the payment is confirmed, the task is published on Crowboy.  
   - Interested users receive a notification and, after passing a heavy CAPTCHA to verify their authenticity, they can accept the task.

3. **Task Execution & Verification**  
   - Task doers complete the task while screen recording their activity (e.g., liking posts, commenting, following, or spending time on the profile).  
   - The screen recording is uploaded to the Crowboy Telegram bot.  
   - AI checks verify that the task was executed properly. If the task meets all criteria, the task doer receives payment.

4. **Earnings & Commission**  
   - Upon successful verification, the earnings are distributed, with Crowboy taking a **10%** commission from the task creator’s budget.
